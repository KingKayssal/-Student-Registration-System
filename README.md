### Key Features

- **Notifications:** Receive alerts for new registrations, errors, and important system events.

### Usage
- Open `backend/admin/index.html` in your browser to access the admin dashboard and all management tools.
- Use the navigation bar to switch between dashboard, user management, audit logs, settings, database tools, security controls, and notifications.
- For full functionality, start the backend API server (`node admin-server.js`) to enable data operations.

The admin page is designed for ease of use, security, and full control over your student registration system.
